## About This Project

The DBT Awareness Portal stands as a web application crafted to enlighten users about the **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)** scheme. Its core purpose is to enable simulated Aadhaar-linked account verification and serve as a central hub for essential resources, including scholarship information, and various event listings.

> **Note:** This is an educational and demonstration project. It does not hold affiliation with any government entity and the verification functionalities are simulated.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

Our portal delivers focused functionalities designed for clarity and user engagement:

- **DBT Verification:** Provides a simulated mechanism to verify if an Aadhaar-linked account is eligible for DBT.
- **Student Resources:** Offers consolidated access to information regarding scholarships, educational events, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) initiatives.
- **Interactive Pages:** Features quizzes and educational content to enhance user understanding of DBT.
