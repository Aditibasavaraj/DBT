> A compelling hero image featuring digital interfaces, abstract data flows, and iconography related to information access and financial transfers, set against a backdrop of connectivity and learning. The design should be modern, clean, and use a vibrant, trustworthy color palette (e.g., blues, greens, purples) to convey empowerment through knowledge.

## About This Project

The DBT Awareness Portal stands as a full-stack web application crafted to enlighten users about the **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)** scheme. Its core purpose is to enable simulated Aadhaar-linked account verification and serve as a central hub for essential resources, including scholarship information, event listings, and various STEM initiatives.

> **Note:** This is an educational and demonstration project. It does not hold affiliation with any government entity and the verification functionalities are simulated.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

Our portal delivers focused functionalities designed for clarity and user engagement:

- **DBT Verification:** Provides a simulated mechanism to verify if an Aadhaar-linked account is eligible for DBT.
- **Student Resources:** Offers consolidated access to information regarding scholarships, educational events, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) initiatives.
- **Notifications & Alerts:** Keeps users informed with timely updates related to DBT and associated benefits.
- **Interactive Pages:** Features quizzes and educational content to enhance user understanding of DBT.
